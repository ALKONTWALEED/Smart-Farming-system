# Title: Smart Irrigation System with Environmental Monitoring using Arduino

# Idea of Project
This project presents a smart and autonomous irrigation system that aims to optimize water usage while maintaining ideal environmental conditions for plant growth. With growing concerns about water scarcity and the need for sustainable agriculture, this system provides a reliable solution by automatically watering plants only when needed, based on real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data. Additionally, it activates cooling fans to regulate microclimate conditions when temperature or humidity levels exceed pre-defined thresholds.

The core concept of this project lies in its ability to continuously monitor the environmental parameters and respond intelligently without human intervention. Using a combination of a DHT11 sensor, soil moisture sensor, relay-controlled water pump, and fan module, the system provides a balanced environment for plant health. Real-time data is also displayed on an OLED screen for visual feedback, enhancing the user's ability to monitor conditions locally.

This solution is ideal for home gardens, greenhouses, or small-scale farms where resource conservation and automation are critical. It is a step forward toward sustainable agriculture and smart farming technologies, especially in regions where water management is crucial.

# Components
The system is built using accessible, cost-effective electronic components programmed through the Arduino IDE. The components include:

Arduino UNO/Nano: Acts as the main control unit, processing all sensor data and executing decisions.

Soil Moisture Sensor: Detects the level of water in the soil. If the moisture drops below a defined threshold, it triggers the watering system.

DHT11 Sensor: Measures the ambient temperature and humidity, allowing the system to regulate microclimate conditions.

Relay Module: Controls the water pump based on decisions made by the Arduino.

Water Pump: Delivers water to the soil when needed, based on sensor input.

Fan Module: Activated when the temperature or humidity goes beyond the preset limits to improve air circulation.

OLED Display (SSD1306): A 128x64 pixel screen that provides real-time feedback on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels.

Jumper Wires and Breadboard: For circuit integration and prototyping.

These components work together in real-time to ensure optimal conditions are maintained and that irrigation is done only when necessary, thereby conserving water and improving efficiency.
